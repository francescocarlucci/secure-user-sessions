# Secure User Sessions

Secure User Sessions is a simple plugin for WordPress that implements an additional security layer by tying user sessions to the IP used upon login.

It's intended to mitigate forged sessions and data leaks coming from stolen cookies. Inspired by the study of NordVPN on stolen cookies sold on dark web: https://nordvpn.com/research-lab/stolen-cookies-study/

The plugin is only a proof of concept, not ready for prouction yet.
